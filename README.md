#Running Pace Calculator

I wanted to pace myself while I ran in order to run a certain time in a certain distance. For example, how long should it take me to run a quarter mile if I want to make sure I finish 2 miles in 15 minutes? Welcome back to math class. Calculating this was annoying because I had to keep converting the time in a decimal and also had to account for different intervals of a mile. So I decided to automate it.

Using an HTML file for the interface, I composed the math functions using JavaScript. Bam, done. With the file having only 40 lines of code, I knew that the organization of the JavaScript file wasn't critical, but I was still curious about the best way to structure the program. I had already created a large application using React, but how would a small app look using React? So re-built the program with React.
